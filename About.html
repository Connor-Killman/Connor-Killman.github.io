			<p style="flex-basis:70%">&emsp;&emsp;My name is Connor Killman. I was born in 2004 in Kennewick, Washington. When I was five, I began attending classes at Mid Columbia Partnership. MCP, as it was called, was a cooperative program with parents in that parents taught most of the classes at home under a homeschool-like environment. However, for a few classes each week, students would attend classes at MCP’s campus. I started school at MCP for kindergarten and stayed until the 8th grade. In middle school I attended classes on photography/videography, archery, and science, all of which helped to start my interest in the world and are hobbies that I like to do today. Also during my middle school years, I joined a Destination Imagination (DI) team for three years. It was during DI where I learned to lead teams, value peoples input, and make snap decisions under pressure. DI is also responsible for teaching me the value of creativity and adaptability, both of which me and my teams needed to progress in the DI competitions. As great fun as DI was though, I was getting older. I needed to decide where I was going to go to high school. </br> </br> &emsp;&emsp;At the end of 8th grade, I applied for and was accepted into Delta high school through their lottery admissions system. Delta had a heavy focus on STEM and workplace skills that I felt other high schools and my mother simply could not provide. My freshmen year at Delta was rather boring was I was content to do nothing more than getting good grades, however it was my sophomore year that made my high school career much more interesting. As school started to settle back into its rhythm back from summer break, I joined a club under the name “CyberPatriots.” I didn’t know much about them, but I did like computers. Quickly, I realized what the CyberPatriots were all about. The CyberPatriot competition was a multi-national competition organized by the United States Airforce to encourage kids to enter the world of cybersecurity. It worked. My first year was lackluster as one may expect with virtually no experience in the realm of cyber security beforehand, but I gained valuable knowledge about Linux operating systems like Debian and Ubuntu as I was the team specialist for these images, never mind I had only dived into them that year. Valuable gains in knowledge aside however, it was also the year that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, better known as the virus that causes COVID-19, made it into the US and shut down the country. Because I only learned about the virus, and that the country was shutting down in the few hours before it actually happened, one day everything was fine and on schedule, and the next was the beginning of a two-year futile attempt to control the virus. My third trimester was done entirely online, zoom meetings were common, but as the virus was still so new, I wasn’t required to go to them. I didn’t attend another class, online or in-person, until my junior year.</p>

		<p>&emsp;&emsp;My junior year kept the excitement going with the school districts finally starting to make sense about to continue in the midst of the pandemic. Classes were entirely online. CyberPatriots continued online as well, and that year I became the Cisco Specialist. In this role, I managed all things Cisco or the competition, which meant heavy usage of Cisco Packet Tracer and was the led on the Cisco Quiz. My team did well enough to join the platinum ranks that year. Senior year I decided to become the Vice-president of the club and rounded out my computer experience as I managed Windows 10 and Windows Server in that year’s competition. Combining all my knowledge about computers, I utilized batch and ps1 scripts to automate a large part of basic security policies for me so I could devote more time to the advanced ones. My Senior year, my team reached the Semi-final round in the platinum division. While we didn’t do too well there, the platinum division is only the best of the best, which meant we were still in the top 5% in the competition. Now, I have entered the 3rd trimester of my senior year. For this last trimester, I will work on my capstone project and continue my advances in knowledge. </p>
